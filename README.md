# Scarpet Docs

Scarpet documentation in a more accessible format.

The plan is for this to be turned into a browsable website for easier Minecraft
tinkering.

## Why is this needed?

Because Scarpet documentation in [gnembon/fabric-carpet] is not in a parsable
format so it cannot be read automatically to create tooling such as
[scarpet-ls].
